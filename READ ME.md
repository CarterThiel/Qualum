THE COLLATZ CONTINUUM
by Carter Thiel

If 3n+1 is performed properly, every odd number it produces has an even input and an even output but not every even number has an odd input and odd output. Accordingly, more than half of numbers produced by 3n+1 must be even. Half of all numbers are odd and half are even. It would seem that the Collatz conjecture is not satisfied by some numbers and therefore is false. However, this also means that any set of numbers not satisfying the conjecture has to contain more odd numbers than even numbers and not every odd number would have an even input and an even output. Any system producing a set of these "non-Collatz satisfying" numbers would be inconsistent and erroneous, it would not be performing 3n+1 properly. Therefore the Collatz conjecture must be true. [1]
	This also means that any completion of the infinite set would be inconsistent, it will not only be possible to have a new number, it should have a new number if we are applying the rules of the Collatz conjecture. This is similar to Cantor's “diagonal” argument and his proof of the inconsistency of the absolute infinity. [2] Except this proof shows that all infinities have same size.

Cantor’s diagonal argument says we could make another number “00” so it would be possible for the base and index to contain another number, therefore we should make another number if we are counting. Obviously the diagonal argument is just a visual representation of the fact that the size of the index is always logarithmic in relation to the power. [2]

The “vertical argument” states that we would make another number with Base: 2 Index: 3 from “101” or “011”. If one has written the list above they have necessarily written the list below. If we are counting we should count all possible numbers we can make from our base and index.

This process can be cyclically repeated infinitely, and even works for natural numbers. Infinity shall be named “Ᵹ”.

	Since the index is always logarithmic to the power then the vertical argument would make a number with a larger index. We can visually see the natural numbers are uncountable because a list (which is how you count) of them would require writing a number larger than the largest number, this would happen the number after log10(Ᵹ). This behavior shall be called “teleonomy”. Diagonal teleonomy simply means we are in the realm of possibility (could) and only when we achieve certainty indirectly do we come to rest at horizontal teleonomy, which is reinforced (should). Vertical teleonomy being enforced (would), never enters the realm of possibility, it is initially and eternally in the realm of certainty.  Like a long object with two forces perpendicular to the surface below it moving in both directions, the strength of these forces changing very randomly and drastically, and a third force attracting the object to the surface like gravity eventually overpowering the other two at a close enough range to the surface. Should is certain, but not the same as would which is stronger because we added no new rules. These proofs are “teleonomic proofs” of their type. This is a vertical teleonomic proof for the continuum hypothesis being false, at Ᵹ we actually made a set of numbers with a cardinality greater than the natural numbers and less than the real numbers [3]. It is also a horizontal teleonomic proof that all infinities are absolutely infinite, they should all be the same size but also have some difference between them, the relative size of the units making their bases called “monads”. The only way we can express infinities is by a relation between Ᵹ and another number, similar to the imaginary unit.



Notes:
	I was in the middle of writing a full paper about the implications of these discoveries and it became apparent that the time I would need to complete the paper properly would be far out of the scope of how long I wanted to wait to announce the discoveries. Here is an SHA-512 hash output of the current state of the paper and another of some notes as proof. More hashes will be posted periodically as edits and additions until the full paper is released.
